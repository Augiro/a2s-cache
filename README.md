# a2s-cache
Cache of A2S queries used in Source Engine games, written in Go.

This project is meant to mimic the functionality of [SourcEngineeQueryCacher](https://github.com/hyperxpro/SourceEngineQueryCacher/), 
but written in Go, as I found it wasteful to run a high-level language for this purpose (JVM itself uses about 100MB
of RAM).

I made this project as I wanted a simple solution for my tiny VPS through which my server running from home is
being tunneled.

**TODO:** Write usage documentation. Let me know if there is interest, if so I will be more motivated to update this.
